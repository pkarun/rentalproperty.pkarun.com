Yesterday, one tenant vacated our property.

If you manage a rental unit, you may know how time-consuming and stressful it is to get the property ready for the next tenant.

Not these days for us.

In earlier days, we took many shortcuts to save money on repainting tasks, such as:

- Using male labour for painting tasks.  
- Hiring painters with little experience.  
- Employing inexperienced labour to clean the property (toilet, kitchen, etc.).  
- Sometimes, even all our family members did some of the tasks ourselves.  

It’s honestly not a good practice.

But things changed greatly when our rental units increased from 3 to 16. It’s simply impossible for us to manage this work ourselves or take shortcuts these days.

Now, we rely on experienced labour for painting and cleaning tasks.

Thankfully, we have an awesome painter who handles both repainting and cleaning tasks for us.

Currently, as of 19/12/2023, we pay him ₹2,500 to repaint and clean a 1 BHK unit. This work includes:

- Cleaning the property (toilet, kitchen, bedroom, windows, etc.).  
- Repainting walls.  

This does not include:

- Painting the ceiling.  
- Painting wooden window shutters (if applicable).  

If these additional tasks are needed, we pay ₹500 extra.

This painter is excellent at his job. After hiring him, we no longer have to guide or supervise the work. He takes care of everything independently.

This is what every property owner needs: a reliable worker who can handle tasks without constant supervision. In the past, when we used inexperienced labour, we had to micromanage everything. We are now happy to pay a little extra for the right person and save time and stress.

Finding good labour isn’t easy. If you find someone dependable, treat them well so they feel happy to work with you.

We found our current painter during the construction of our building through our painting contractor. Among a few labourers, I noticed two who were skilled and easy to work with. I discreetly asked them if they handled repainting and cleaning tasks. Both said yes and requested not to inform their contractor. I agreed and saved their contact details.

After the construction was complete, I needed a painter for repainting work. I called one of them, tested his work over two projects, and was satisfied with the results. After that, I negotiated the price, explained the scope of work, and informed him of my conditions. He agreed.

Now, I simply call him, ensure he has all the required materials, and let him handle the work. My dad and I occasionally check the property, and if anything is missed, he addresses it promptly.

Having good labourers saves a lot of headaches when cleaning rental units. Hire smart, reliable workers who can manage the tasks independently. Pay them well and treat them with respect.

Our family is always happy to have found and worked with such dependable labourers.
