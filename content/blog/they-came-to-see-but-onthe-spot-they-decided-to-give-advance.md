It was 7:45 PM, and my brother Avinash called me saying, "someone is waiting outside… go and show the house."

I immediately went and saw some students coming near to our house. I asked whether you were the one who called my brother.

They said NO.

I was confused.

Then I asked them, are you looking for the house? They said YES.

As I was thinking, then who called my brother… I saw 2 other people waiting outside to see the house. When asked, they said, "We only called."

OK. I told them to wait as other students were seeing the house.

While waiting in the parking, they saw students interested in the property.

And students need the ground floor.

Students asked me, "Do they also need the ground floor?"

I said, "Yes."

### **Now the FUN begins…**

Both of them liked the property, needed the ground floor house itself, saw the other party like it, and only 1 unit was available.

The competition started between them.

A student tried to reach their mom to finalize the property, but unfortunately, they couldn’t reach them on time.

The students collected my number and told me, "Just let us know before giving it to anyone." I told them I don’t do that.

Meanwhile, the 2 people, while they were ready to give advance, I got to know they would stay with 3 people in the house, so I said, "Sorry, we don’t give to 3 people."

They were ready to pay higher rent, but I said no. They left with disappointment.

### **They didn’t leave there itself…**

They called my brother the next day to convince him. After he said OK, they came back the next day to give advance.

We now raised the rent and booked the house for them.

Immediately after that, I got a call from the students to book, and I told them, "Sorry, it was already booked."

### **Here are the few things that helped to book a house too fast**

1) **Scarcity**: Only 1 unit was available on the ground floor, but 2 parties were interested simultaneously—this automatically created demand.

2) **Urgency**: Both of them knew another party had also shown interest in the property, and if they didn’t act immediately, they could lose it.

3) **Proofs**: If I told them someone showed interest in the property, it would be less powerful without valid proof. They saw it in front of their eyes. Make sure whatever you say, say it with proof, case studies, stories, and example incidents.

These are the 3 psychological factors that influenced them to finalize the property almost on the spot.

Use these 3 factors when required.
