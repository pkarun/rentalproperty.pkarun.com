A few days back, one family vacated the rental unit near my home. If I’m not wrong, they stayed less than 6 months.

**It’s a brand-new building and brand-new owner.**

The owner doesn’t have experience renting the building, and they gave rent for a **short term**.

We used to make the same mistake when renting our building for the first time.

We gave rent for 3 months as well.

At that time, we didn’t know a few things, so we rented as and when any tenants requested a short-term stay (a few months). We were happy to collect rent and painting charges when vacating.

After a few such incidents, we realized renting to short-term tenants was not worth the hassle.

### The reason is…  

It’s **more work for us**.

Imagine you rent a unit for 1 month to a tenant.

They stayed 1 month and left.

Now… you, the owner, must hire painters and cleaners.

You need to put a "TO-Let" board, spend time with laborers to get the job done, and deal with the vacancy until the next tenants show up.

We soon started realizing our mistake of renting for a short-term stay. After making this mistake a few times, we no longer rent to those who want to stay less than 1 year.

The money we earn is simply **not worth the stress** of cleaning the property and getting it ready for the next tenants.

I’m sure the same thing will also happen with the new building owner.

Maybe they will rent to a few more such tenants. After some experience, they will also stop renting to tenants who want to stay less than 6 months.

The new building owner has already started cleaning and painting by himself. The cleaning process will continue for a few more days.

### Not all will tell the truth.  

Not all will openly say they will stay only a few months.

Some intentionally tell lies to get into the property.

So how do you handle such cases?

Having **strict rental agreement rules** helps in such cases.

By explaining such rules **before renting**, tenants often disqualify themselves from getting into your property.

I will talk about such conditions in the rental agreement later.
